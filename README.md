# Portfolio (public)

This repository is intentionally **scoped to `03_PORTFOLIO/site/` only** so no other CAREER materials can ever be pushed publicly by accident.

## GitHub Pages

- GitHub Pages should serve from the **repository root**.
- Entry point: `index.html` (redirects to `charlotte_prevost_gis_portfolio.html`).

## Safety rule

Only run git commands **inside this folder**.
